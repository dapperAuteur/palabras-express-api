# fourLetterWords-express-api

## Purpose of app
I created this app to build an application that would help me grow in my personal life. It will be a tool for me to expand my English and Spanish vocabulary, track my expenses, and document my growth using a blog.
It contains three word lists: four letter words, prefix and suffix words, and Spanish verbs.

## Tools used:
bcrypt
body-parser
cors
dotenv
express
jsonwebtoken
mongoose

## To start using this repo:
clone the repo
cd palabras-express-api/
